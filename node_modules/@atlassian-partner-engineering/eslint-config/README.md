# @atlassian-partner-engineering/eslint-config

**ESLint [Shareable Config](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/shareable-configs)**

## Note

The idea was to have strict linter config which would fit the best for all the projects and not too annoying to work with.

Airbnb's config was taken as the basis. Some rules of it were rewritten with standard eslint config and some of them with custom rules requested by the team

This config includes:

- [Airbnb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb)
- [Standard](https://github.com/standard/eslint-config-standard)
- [Standard React](https://github.com/standard/eslint-config-standard-react)
- [Jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-jest)
- custom rules

This config can be used both on server and client side.

## Install

```bash
npm install -D @atlassian-partner-engineering/eslint-config
```

## Usage

Shareable configs are designed to work with the `extends` feature of `.eslintrc` files. You can learn more about [Shareable Config](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/shareabke-configs) on the official ESLint website.

Add this to your `.eslintrc` file:

```json
{
  "extends": "@atlassian-partner-engineering"
}
```

*Note: We omitted the `eslint-config` from the full package name since it is automatically assumed by ESLint.*

You can override settings from the shareable config by adding them directly into your `.eslintrc` file.

## Publishing this library
